# About the Author(s)
This project is the brainchild of my then 9-year old son, Owen, who wanted to learn some basic web development concepts.  He came up with the idea of building a math quiz game as a way to hone his development skills.  The code here is entirely his, with only minor coaching, and a lot of searching [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com/howto/default.asp). Special thanks to Violet, my 7-year old daughter who has been very helpful testing this app.
