# About the Author(s)
This project is the brainchild of my (almost) 10-year old son, Owen, who wanted to learn some basic web development concepts.  He came up with the idea of building a math quiz game as a way to hone his development skills.  The code here is entirely his, with only minor coaching, and a lot of searching [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com/howto/default.asp).
