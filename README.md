# About the Developer
I created this project when I was 9 years old as a way to test and hone my web development skills. With minor coaching from my dad, XYZMath has grown into what it is now. Special thanks to my now 7-year old sister, Violet, for testing XYZMath. I also had some help from researching on [W3 Schools](https://w3schools.com). For more details about me, click [here](https://robotleopard86.github.io/XYZMath/about.html). The app has a dark theme and light theme available, with light theme being the default. The site uses a cookie to save theme data, but so far, we cannot get it to work on iOS.
